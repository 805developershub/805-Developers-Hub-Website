The 805 Developers Hub is a language agnostic meetup for developers of all levels in the 805 area to learn and build software projects together.

📆 **When:**

We meet every other Thursday, so come join us! We want developers who are passionate about learning and committed to growing the developer community. This is an open-ended group to help members meet like-minded collaborators, connect with local tech companies, and produce real projects together. 

As a brand new group, we are open to your ideas for shaping our future meetups, so please share your feedback and get involved in our community!
