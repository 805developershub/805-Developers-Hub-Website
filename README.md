# 805 Developers Hub

üîó **[View our Meetup page](https://www.meetup.com/LearnToCodeLA/events/235361705/)**

The 805 Developers Hub is a meetup for developers of all levels in the 805 area to learn and build projects together.

üìÜ **When:**

We meet every other Thursday (sometimes every Thursday, just check the website), so come join us! We want developers who are passionate about learning and committed to growing the developer community. This is an open-ended group to help members meet like-minded collaborators, connect with local tech companies, and produce real projects together.

We use the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com) platform as part of our learning, and it's a perfect way for our group to contribute to meaningful projects. If your not familiar with freeCodeCamp check out the link above and set up an account before coming to the meetup.

üíª **What to bring:**

* (Optional) Your laptop and charger. If you don't have a laptop, you can pair up with someone else who has one.
* (Optional) A project or coding challenge you're working on.
* Great attitude and curious mind!

üíª **Prerequisites:**

* There are none! We wan't you to come no matter what.
* But, we will be working on freeCodeCamp stuff.
* So, set up a freeCodeCamp profile and get ready.
